# factory-internship
 
I had quite a bit of fun putting this together. A couple notes:

1. Please install the requirements.txt file if you want to run the code.
2. I had originally planned to interface with Jira, and I wrote all the necessary code out to make the post, but it seems like my free Jira plan doesn't allow me to change permissions on creating issues; as such, I wasn't able to actually complete the posting with my token. However, with your token, it *should* work just fine.
3. Make sure to put your api keys in the necessary spots. Also don't forget to put the Jira project key if you want to use that.
4. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! Thanks!
